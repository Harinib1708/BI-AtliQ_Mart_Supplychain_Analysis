# BI-Supplychain_FMCG_domain 🚀

## Background
- AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. 
- It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara.
- They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart faces a challenge as key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to service issues, likely stemming from repeated delays or incomplete deliveries of essential products. To address this before expanding to other cities, management has tasked the supply chain analytics team with daily tracking of 'On Time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels for all customers. This will enable swift responses to any service issues.

## Key Metrics
- OT% (On Time Percentage): Measures the percentage of orders delivered on time.
- IF% (In Full Percentage): Indicates the percentage of orders delivered in full quantity.
- OTIF% (On Time and In Full Percentage): Reflects the percentage of orders delivered both on time and in full quantity.
- LIFR% (Line Fill Rate) : Measures the percentage of customer orders completely fulfilled from stock on hand, indicating inventory management efficiency.
- VOFR%(Volume Fill Rate) : Measures the proportion of the total ordered volume delivered on time, indicating supply chain efficiency and reliability.
